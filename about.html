        <p>My life in a nutshell: I was born and raised in West Bloomfield, Michigan in a family of five, one of which is my identical twin sister. Having a twin has played perhaps the most influential role in my life and is something that I have learned to truly appreciate. My family is extremely important to me, and I am constantly thankful for all that they have done for me.  Also, my friends are a large network of support that I always turn to when needed, which I am grateful of.  When it comes to passions, I am fascinated by the ways in which people are impacted by social media platforms and the information surrounding them through the means of our digital world.  On a lighter note, I am passionate about health and wellness.  Maintaining a consistent and beneficial daily routine, involving clean eating and exercise, has kept me at a healthy state, both physically and mentally.  Furthermore, I am a self-proclaimed foodie and have co-run a food Instagram blog with my identical twin for many years (@twinstalktaste).  I am always on the lookout for delicious  new meals or cool restaurants to try!</p>
        <p>Skills: I am a very hardworking and determined person in all facets of life.  I always strive to achieve the goals that I set for myself, and persevere through anything that gets in the way.  I have very strong communication skills, both verbal and written, which I find to be very important as we transition into an increasingly digital world.  To continue, I am a skilled writer, having held leadership positions as Editor-in-Chief and Editorial Director of two organizations.  I have published multiple articles and really enjoy writing.  Referring to my more technical skills, I am proficient in Python and am currently learning HTML and CSS.  With this in mind, I am always interested in expanding these skills and learning other languages, as well.  I ensure that I remain open-minded, inclusive, and critical of all the work that I produce, always looking for ways to improve what I have previously created.  With the above being said, I am very curious, always seeking to learn more about a variety of subjects, and enjoy gaining new skills.  </p>
        <p>Looking ahead: I am a plannerâ€¦ and what happens when you are a planner? You like to plan out the future. In the near future, I plan to hold a job for a social media company as a User Experience Researcher after graduating from the School of Information. With the skills that I gain from being a UX researcher, I would like to aid this specific social media company in improving their platform to be more usable and enjoyable for users, with a strong focus on teenagers. In the less-near future, I plan to be a leading voice in the social media community as a figure who has influenced social media platforms for the better. I believe that I can improve the reciprocal techno-societal relationship between users and the social media platforms they use.</p>
